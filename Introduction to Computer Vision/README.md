## Introduction to Computer Vision

According to this lesson, computer vision pipeline is: 

Input data -> Pre-processing -> Area of interest selection -> Feature extraction -> Recognition

These lessons cover tools for pre-processing and CNNs for feature extraction.

### [Lesson 2]()
Representation of the image. Result mini-project: day-night classifier.

### [Lesson 3]()
Filters. Included some notes.

### [Lesson 4]()
Types of features and image segmentation. Included some notes.

### [Lesson 5]()
Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF (ORB) as a feature extractor.

### [Lesson 6]()
CNNs. FashionMNIST recognition with PyTorch.

### Facial Keypoints
Facial Keypoints Detector. There are Jupyter Notebooks with the all information to know.
